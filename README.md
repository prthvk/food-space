## About the Application

This is an Single Page Application that uses zomato api to get top restaurants details in a city and also search for for restaurants in a particular city.

The login details are given below
username - admin
password - pass

You can sign in and add the restaurants in the favourites page.


P.S. - I had started with JustBooks api but the api itself was too limited and couldn't do more with it. So, I asked for a change of api and did with zomato api.
